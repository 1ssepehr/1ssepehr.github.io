            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Sepehr Madani. I'm a CS sophomore at UML, passionate about software
                design and user interface designs.
                <br/><br/> Playing piano and chess are a few of my hobbies!

            <h2>ONR (Optical Note Recognition)</h2>
            <p><em>September 2015 - June 2016</em></p>
            <p>
                I was inspired to start working on ONR after having trouble with sight-reading
                in playing the piano. I was looking for something similar to OCR but for musical
                sheets to help me read the notes quickly and easily. The result was ONR, a MATLAB-based
                project to extract musical information from an image of a music sheet.
                <br/>The final edition of our program was able to identify staff lines, the Treble and
                Bass clefs, measures, and notes themselves (but not their duration).
                We had several limitation in the image processing section, such as identifying rests,
                time signatures, note durations.
