            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Sepehr Madani. I'm a CS sophomore at UML, passionate about software
                design and user interface designs.
                <br/><br/> I have been recently working on Nulli-fi Python package, a testbed for testing
                and analyzing different algorithms for nullifying  interference in mmWave phased arrays.
                <br/><br/> Playing piano and chess are a few of my hobbies!

            <h2>Nulli-fi</h2>
            <p><em>January 2020 - present</em></p>
            <p>
                Nulli-fi is a practical null steering system for mmWave LAN networks.
                I helped a Master's candidate by creating and maintaining a Python package
                for testing and analyzing different algorithms for nullifying  interference
                in mmWave phased arrays. I designed a GUI using 
                <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/">PySide2</a> 
                to streamline the simulation process and create a visualizer for performance tests.
                <br/> The project is available privately on 
                <a href="https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/smadani2/nulling-python">this GitLab repository</a>,
                and will become public after the publication of the corresponding research paper is concluded.

            <h2>ONR (Optical Note Recognition)</h2>
            <p><em>September 2015 - June 2016</em></p>
            <p>
                I was inspired to start working on ONR after having trouble with sight-reading
                in playing the piano. I was looking for something similar to OCR but for musical
                sheets to help me read the notes quickly and easily. The result was ONR, a MATLAB-based
                project to extract musical information from an image of a music sheet.
                <br/>The final edition of our program was able to identify staff lines, the Treble and
                Bass clefs, measures, and notes themselves (but not their duration).
                We had several limitation in the image processing section, such as identifying rests,
                time signatures, note durations.
